# Overview

[eland](https://github.com/elastic/eland) is an open source, Apache2-licensed Elasticsearch Python client to analyse, explore and manipulate data that resides in Elasticsearch. Where possible the package uses existing Python APIs and data structures to make it easy to switch between Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn to their Elasticsearch powered equivalents. In general, the data resides in Elasticsearch and not in memory, which allows eland to access large datasets stored in Elasticsearch.

# Installation

> JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. JupyterLab is extensible and modular: write plugins that add new components and integrate with existing ones.

JupyterLab can be installed using pip

```
pip install jupyterlab
````
> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

Jupyter Notebook  can be installed using pip

```
pip install notebook
